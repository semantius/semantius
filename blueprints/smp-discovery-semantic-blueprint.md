# SMP Discovery and Catalog

## 1. Overview

Discovery of sanctioned and shadow SaaS, app inventory, ownership, integrations, lifecycle staging, catalog publication, and operational signal/alerts. The discovery substrate of an SMP deployment.

## 2. Entity summary

| Name | data_object | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App Catalog Listings | `smp_app_catalog_listings` | Published listings of sanctioned SaaS apps that employees can browse and request, with description, owner, request route, and approval flow. |
| App Lifecycle Stages | `smp_app_lifecycle_stages` | Portfolio-rationalization stages of a SaaS app such as evaluate, pilot, sanctioned, sunset, and retired. |
| SaaS Alerts | `smp_alerts` | System-raised alerts on the SaaS portfolio: shadow-IT signups, projected license overages, opening renewals, or vendor-risk changes. |
| SaaS App Integrations | `smp_app_integrations` | Configured connections between the SaaS management platform and an app's APIs for sign-on, provisioning, finance, and usage data. |
| SaaS App Owners | `smp_app_owners` | Typed owner assignments linking a user to a SaaS app as its business, IT, finance, or security owner. |
| SaaS Applications | `saas_applications` | SaaS applications in the company portfolio, with vendor, category, criticality, owner, and whether each is sanctioned or shadow IT. |
| Shadow IT Apps | `shadow_it_apps` | SaaS apps found in use but not officially sanctioned, discovered through expense data, sign-on logs, browser, or network signals. |

## 6. Cross-domain context

### 6.1 Master consumers (other modules / domains that embed this scope's masters)

| data_object | other module / domain | role | necessity | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `saas_applications` | APM-PORTFOLIO-REGISTRY (Portfolio Registry) - APM | consumer | optional | - |
| `saas_applications` | IGA-ENTITLEMENT-CATALOG (IGA Entitlement Catalog) - IGA | consumer | optional | Newly discovered or sanctioned SaaS apps trigger entitlement registration in IGA catalog. |

### 6.2 Outbound handoffs (events this scope publishes)

| source module | target domain | target module | trigger_event | transition | payload | integration | friction | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | IGA | IGA-ENTITLEMENT-CATALOG | `saas_application.discovered` | _(lifecycle)_ | `saas_applications` | event_stream | medium | Newly discovered SaaS apps surface to IGA for shadow-IT visibility and access governance. |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | IGA | IGA-ENTITLEMENT-CATALOG | `saas_application.sanctioned` | _(lifecycle)_ | `saas_applications` | api_call | low | Sanctioned SaaS apps are wired into IGA provisioning catalog. |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | FINOPS | _(domain-level)_ | `saas_application.sanctioned` | _(lifecycle)_ | `saas_applications` | event_stream | medium | Sanctioned SaaS apps come under FINOPS spend tracking. |

### 6.3 Inbound handoffs (events this scope reacts to)

| target module | source domain | source module | trigger_event | transition | payload | integration | friction | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | DISCOVERY | _(domain-level)_ | `sso_login.unsanctioned_app` | _(state_change)_ | `shadow_it_apps` | event_stream | medium | SSO logs reveal a login to a SaaS app that's not in the sanctioned catalog - flagged as shadow IT. Complements the EXPENSE-side detection: SSO catches apps that use corporate SSO but aren't tracked; expense catches credit-card paid apps that don't. |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | EXPENSE | _(domain-level)_ | `card.saas_charge_detected` | _(state_change)_ | `shadow_it_apps` | event_stream | high | Corporate-card SaaS charge detected by the expense system surfaces a candidate shadow-IT app in SMP. High friction: finance sees the charge, IT/SMP sees (or doesn't see) the app - reconciling vendor-name-on-card with app-name-in-portfolio is messy and is one of the highest-value SMP-to-EXPENSE integrations. |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | SMP | SMP-RENEWAL-VENDOR | `smp_vendor_risk_assessment.remediation_required` | _(state_change)_ | `smp_alerts` | lifecycle_progression | low | A vendor risk assessment requiring remediation raises a portfolio alert on the application. |
| SMP-DISCOVERY | SPEND-MGMT | SPEND-MGMT-CARDS | `card_transaction.posted` | `posted` _(signal)_ | `shadow_it_apps` | api_call | high | SaaS purchases on corporate cards reveal shadow IT to SMP - merchant categorization required to identify SaaS subscriptions vs other spend, then deduplicated against the existing SMP saas_subscription catalog. The card-side discovery path is the primary signal for off-procurement SaaS today. Shadow-data pattern. |
